Hello, my name is Alexander. I am thirty. I study in The Rolling Scopes.
I want to speak about the TypeScript language.


#TYPESCRIPT

##HISTORY

TypeScript development began in late 2012. Although it originated at Microsoft, 
its real creator is programmer Anders Hejlsberg, also known as the creator of languages like Delphi and C#. 
But this project began to develop as OpenSource.The popularity and relevance of the ideas of the new language
 led to the fact that a number of these ideas will later become part of the new standard JavaScript. 
The new version of one of the most popular platforms for Web - Angular 2/4/5/6 is completely written
 in TypeScript jointly by Microsoft and Google.


##A LITTLE ABOUT THE LANGUAGE...

TypeScript is a JavaScript based programming language.
Why do we need a different programming language for the client side in the web environment, if traditional 
JavaScript copes with this job , which is used on almost every web site?
But TypeScript is not just a new javascript.
At the same time, TypeScript is an extended set of JavaScript, which means that any JS program is a TypeScript
 program. In TS, you can use all those constructions that are used in JS. Moreover, the code on TS is compiled
 into javascript(ES3 +) and supported by the most of browsers.

###MAIN ADVANTAGES:

*Strong typing
*Code readability
*A simpler transition from the world of strict typing, rather than directly to JavaScript, in which the Dynamics rules
*Backward compatibility with javascript
*Broad IDE support


##TYPESCRIPT HAS INFLUENCED BY JAVASCRIPT AND C#

####LANGUAGE FEATURES:
*[Type annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature) and [compile-time](href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile_time) type checking
*[Type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) (automatic data type detection)
*[Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_)
*[Interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming))
*[Enumerated types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type)
*[Modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
*Abbreviated "arrow" syntax for [anonymous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function)
*[Generics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming)
*[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace)
*[Tuples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple)
*[Async/await](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await)



##GET TYPESCRIPT

To get started with TypeScript, install the necessary toolkit. You can install TypeScript in two ways:
 through the NPM package manager or as a plug-in for Visual Studio.
To install NPM, it is natural to first install Node.js, then write "npm install -g typescript" on the command line.

####COMPILING THE APPLICATION:

Create app.js and app.ts files and connect the app.js file to html.
Write code in the app.ts file and in the command line we enter: "tsc app.ts".
The code will appear in the js file, and then just run the page.

##DATA TYPES

*Boolean
*Number
*String
*Array
*Tuple
*Enum
*Any
*Null Ð¸ undefined
*Void: no specific value, mainly used as the return type of functions
*Never: no specific value and is used as the return type of functions that generate or return an error
*Object


##VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS

We can create variables and constants, as in JavaScript. Using quotes is the same.
IT'S EXAMPLE VARIABLE DECLARATIONS:
on slides we can see that...example.


##FUNCTIONS

Function created like JavaScript but we must add types for function and variables and constants.
We can created functions standard like function declaration and function expression.
Also do callback function and every function on slide we can see it.
more information we can  read in the official site Typescript and one of the good sites it is Metanit.
Thank you.
